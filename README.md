# Connect 4 AI
This is just a small AI I wrote in rust for connect 4.

## Todo
* Use bitboards for the whole position and player pieces
* Add transposition table so that board values are cached, unique keys from bitboards added together
* Add variable time searches with iterative deepening
* Extend searches in good positions
